# Welcome

Welcome to the **Meu Pet Minha Vida** project!

This is a cool open-source project that's all about making pet adoption awesome! We're building a website to help furry buddies find their "perfect match" humans. And guess what? We've got an awesome team working on an app too! We're super excited about it!

Below, we will present ways to contribute to the project technically. However, like any product, we rely on contributions from various profiles: Developers, Designers, Product Owners, QAs, UXs. It doesn't matter if you're a beginner or not, the project's idea is also to create a learning network. So feel free to introduce yourself on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/RAnhUJNv2j)!
